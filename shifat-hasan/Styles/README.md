# Instructions

- This folder contains all the style related files and codes.
- All the styles are written in pure CSS, without any CSS framework.
- The styles are organized in separate files for better maintainability.
- The main style file is `styles.css`, which imports other style files as needed.
- Each style file is named according to its purpose, such as `header.css`, `footer.css`, `buttons.css`, etc.
- To use a specific style, simply import the corresponding CSS file in your HTML or main CSS file.
- Make sure to follow the naming conventions and structure for consistency.
- Feel free to modify or add new styles as per your requirements.
