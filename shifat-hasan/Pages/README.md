- It's a Portfolio Project.
- The project is built using ASP.NET WebForms.
- This folder contains WebForm (.aspx) pages for the project.
- Each page is designed to handle specific functionalities such as user registration, login, profile management,
  and other interactive features.
- The pages are built using the ASP.NET WebForms framework, which allows for rapid development of dynamic web applications.
- Ensure that each page is properly linked to the corresponding backend logic in the code-behind files (.aspx.cs).
- Follow best practices for web development, including security measures, responsive design, and user experience.
- Regularly update the pages to incorporate new features and improvements based on user feedback and technological advancements.
- Everything must be very responsive and mobile-friendly, and also for all screen sizes.
- For Frontend functionality, I want to use pure JavaScript from (../Scripts/*.js).
- And, for styling, I want to use pure CSS from (../Styles/*.js).
- Backend will be handled by C# in code-behind files (.aspx.cs).
- I also need an Admin Panel for managing the website content and user data.
- The Admin Panel should have functionalities like user management, content management, and analytics.
- Ensure that the Admin Panel is secure and only accessible to authorized personnel.
- Implement a consistent layout and design across all pages to maintain a cohesive look and feel.

- Implement a blog section where the admin can create, edit, and delete newly published projects and ideas for showing on the homepage.
