# Instructions

- This folder includes C# (.cs) files that will implement functionalities to efficiently interact (CRUD operations) with a database.
- Each file is dedicated to a specific aspect of database management, such as connection handling, data retrieval, data insertion, data updating, and data deletion.
- The code should be modular, well-documented, and follow best practices for database interactions in C#.
- Ensure to include error handling and logging mechanisms to track database operations and issues.
- Use appropriate design patterns where necessary to enhance code maintainability and scalability.
- The database is strictly MySQL, for this project. connectionString is provided in the Web.config file.
- Make sure to include necessary using directives for database connectivity (e.g., using MySql.Data.MySqlClient;).
- Each file should have a clear and concise summary of its purpose and functionality at the top of the file.
- Test each functionality thoroughly to ensure reliability and performance.
